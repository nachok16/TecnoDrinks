# WorkRiaProyect

Notes about the proyect:

This project was created for a subject in 2022, with the purpose to learn new technologies for Web development. In this case, it was decided to use Angular, since it was my first experience using any framework, besides HTML, CSS and JS, with Bootstrap, I tried to explore new tools.

This site displays information provided by a free API called thecocktaildb, where it facilitates the search for drink recipes, being able to filter by name of the drink, by type of drink (Cocktail, soft drink, etc) or by ingredient.

Every time we search for a card, that is, a drink, it will open a modal where it indicates the category,  the ingredients, the proportions, the glass and how it should be prepared.

Also, once a drink is selected, you can navigate through the filters provided by the card, to discover new drinks that did not appear.

In case it is of your interest, the Angular version is 12 and the node version is 14. Here I also leave the API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
