Notes about the proyect:

This project was created for a subject in 2022, with the purpose to learn new technologies for
Web developoment. In this case, it was decided to use Angular, since it was my first expierence
using any framework, besides of HTML, CSS and JS, with Boostrap, I tried to explore new tools.

This site displays information provided by a free API called
thecocktaildb, where it facilitates the search for drink recipes, being able to filter by
name of the drink, by type of drink (Cocktail, soft drink, etc) or by ingredient.

Every time we search for a card, that is, a drink, it will open a modal where it indicates the category, 
the ingredients, the proportions, the glass and how it should be prepared
the drink.

Also, once a drink is selected, you can navigate through the filters providing
by the card, to discover new drinks that did not appear.

In case it is of your interest, the Angular version is 12 and the node version is 14.
Here I also leave the API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
